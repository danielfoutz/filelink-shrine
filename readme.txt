1. CHOOSING A FILE TO CONTROL
--------------------------------------------------------------
When you open Filelink Shrine you will be prompted to choose
a file to control. You can choose just about anything with a
file extension:

.ppt, .doc, .docx, .txt, .html, .etc

For some extensions, you may have to select 'all files (*.*)'
You have now kindled SOURCE FILE.

Note: If you make a mistake and would like to change your
source file, you currently must restart the script in order
to do so. This is an issue I plan to fix if I make future
updates.
--------------------------------------------------------------
2. SETTING INTERVAL TIME
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the white entry space between

INTERVAL:
MINUTES

enter a number (it will be converted to a whole integer) for
minutes between overwriting copies and/or adding a source
control copy. The entry must be a number (so '10' is fine but 
not 'ten').

Note: The entry is not a digital clock. '90' is an hour and a 
half not 1:30.
--------------------------------------------------------------
3. CHOOSING DESTINATION(S)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Filelink has two copy modes: persistent and source control.
You can use both modes at the same time and select up to four
directories for each. You can of course also just select one
or more persistent locations or one or more source control
locations.

Persistent:
-----------
The four yellow buttons on the left allow you to activate up 
to four unique locations for persistently overwritten copies 
of your source file to be copied to. You do not have to use
all or even any of them. 

For each button you activate you will be prompted to choose 
a location to add and update a copy of your source file.

After hitting start, a copy of your source file will be added
to your selected locations. This copy will be overwritten by
an updated copy every interval. Pressing the stop button will
also update the files before exiting the program, regardless
of how long until the current interval is over.

Source Control:
---------------
The four yellow buttons on the right. They function much the
same as the persistent location buttons except rather than
overwriting the copy of your source file at each interval, a
unique time stamped copy of your source file will be added to
the location. 

For example, if your interval is 10 minutes then every ten
minutes a unique time stamped copy of your source file will be
added to all of the locations you have indicated.

file(time1).txt
file(time2).txt
etc

Pressing the stop button will add copies to the locations 
before quitting the program.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------
Filelink Shrine is a free script and application written in
Python 3. You man not sell copies of this software.
If you or anyone you know paid money for this software the 
seller did so illegally. You can notify me of this via my
contact info below or through GitHub.

That said, you have full permission to use any of the source
code for Filelink Shrine in your own projects and experiments,
even if you sell the product (though I wouldn't advise that).
I ask that you don't use any of the contained images or the 
icon. If you do use any of my work for a project or just to
learn I would love to hear about it, please contact me.

The name is a Dark Souls pun, as are the cryptic window header
messages.

CONTACT
--------------------------------------------------------------
My primary reason for making this app was to learn and slowly
add to my resume. This program and its graphical components
were all made by me, except for the threading function that
controls the interval timer which I borrowed from a reference
guide to save time.

At the time of my writing this readme I am fairly new to 
Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but I learnquick and am 
always looking for new challenges andopportunities. For any and 
all business inquiries or opportunities please don't hesitate 
to contact me. This includes open projects or recommendations 
for ways I can improve and further develop my portfolio. 

Thanks for your time.
